<h1>👋🏻Hello everyone!👋🏻</h1>

<p>My name is <strong>Mateusz</strong>. I'm a mechanical engineer, who always wants to learn new things. Becouse of that I started to 
  learning Web development. I hope that hard work and determination helps me to reach my goal - become a software developer,
  who can face-off with every problem he spotted 💪💪💪</p>
